| for the purposes of educating other fellow programmers, programming students and anyone else  |
| wishing to learn about game development, C++ and OOP. The structure of the engine, class      |
| design and overall code is constantly under development.                                      |
|                                                                                               |
| Designed to teach. Made from scratch. Built by hand.  						                |
